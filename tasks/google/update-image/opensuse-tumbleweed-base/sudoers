## Defaults specification
##
## Prevent environment variables from influencing programs in an
## unexpected or harmful way (CVE-2005-2959, CVE-2005-4158, CVE-2006-0151)
Defaults always_set_home
Defaults env_reset
## Change env_reset to !env_reset in previous line to keep all environment variables
## Following list will no longer be necessary after this change
Defaults env_keep = "LANG LC_ADDRESS LC_CTYPE LC_COLLATE LC_IDENTIFICATION LC_MEASUREMENT LC_MESSAGES LC_MONETARY LC_NAME LC_NUMERIC LC_PAPER LC_TELEPHONE LC_TIME LC_ALL LANGUAGE LINGUAS XDG_SESSION_COOKIE"

## to use special input methods. This may allow users to compromise the root
## account if they are allowed to run commands without authentication.

## Do not insult users when they enter an incorrect password.
Defaults !insults

## Use this PATH instead of the user's to find commands.
Defaults secure_path="/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin"
##
## Uncomment to restore the historic behavior where a command is run in
## the user's own terminal.
# Defaults !use_pty
##
## Uncomment to send mail if the user does not enter the correct password.
# Defaults mail_badpass
##
## Uncomment to enable logging of a command's output, except for
## sudoreplay and reboot.  Use sudoreplay to play back logged sessions.
## Sudo will create up to 2,176,782,336 I/O logs before recycling them.
## Set maxseq to a smaller number if you don't have unlimited disk space.
# Defaults log_output
# Defaults!/usr/bin/sudoreplay !log_output
# Defaults!REBOOT !log_output
# Defaults maxseq = 1000
##
## Uncomment to disable intercept and log_subcmds for debuggers and
## tracers.  Otherwise, anything that uses ptrace(2) will be unable
## to run under sudo if intercept_type is set to "trace".
# Defaults!DEBUGGERS !intercept, !log_subcmds
##
## Uncomment to disable intercept and log_subcmds for package managers.
## Some package scripts run a huge number of commands, which is made
## slower by these options and also can clutter up the logs.
# Defaults!PKGMAN !intercept, !log_subcmds

## In the default (unconfigured) configuration, sudo asks for the root password.
## This allows use of an ordinary user account for administration of a freshly
## installed system.

ALL   ALL=(ALL) ALL   # WARNING! Only use this together with 'Defaults targetpw'!
